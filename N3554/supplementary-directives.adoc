.Foreword

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular, the different approval criteria needed for the different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see www.iso.org/directives).

This document was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 184, _Industrial automation systems and integration_, Subcommittee SC 4, _Industrial data_.

The following standing documents provide guidelines for developing International Standards produced by ISO/TC 184/SC 4:

* ISO/TC 184/SC 4 Handbook <<sc4h>>;
* ISO/TC 184/SC 4 Quality manual <<sc4q>>;
* ISO/TC 184/SC 4 Supplementary directives (this document).

The following standing documents provide additional guidelines for developing and publishing SC 4 standards:

* Standard industrial data framework;
* Common resources and guidelines for the identification of common resources;
* Procedures for transposing externally developed specifications into ISO deliverables.

NOTE: Standards specific guidelines are available in a standing documents folder of SC 4 https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=11568437&objAction=browse&viewType=1

The main changes are listed below:

* deletion of all the rules that are already provided by the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018;
* update of the SC 4 requirements;
* update, as examples, of the required text given in this document;
* deletion of the duplicated content that is already provided by any other SC 4 standing document.

The detailed changes compared to edition 4 are identified in <<annexD>>.

This document cancels and replaces all previous versions of SC 4 Supplementary directives — Rules for the structure and drafting of SC 4 standards for industrial data and is applicable with immediate effect to all SC 4 projects.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

This document specifies requirements for the editorial content, subdivisions, layout, and style for the standards developed by ISO/TC 184/SC 4.

This document augments the 2018 edition of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 and does not provide the authority to contravene the requirements of that or any subsequent edition of those directives.

The content of this document is structured as follows:

* characteristics of an SC 4 standard (see <<cls_4>>);
* requirements for the structure and content of SC 4 standards (see <<cls_5>>);
* EXPRESS presentation style (see <<cls_6>>);
* ISO 8000 series structure and content requirements (see <<cls_7>>);
* ISO 10303 series structure and content requirements (see <<cls_8>>);
* ISO 15926 series structure and content requirements (see <<cls_9>>);
* ISO 18876 series structure and content requirements (see <<cls_10>>).

This document includes requirements specific to the standards developed by SC 4. Some of these requirements apply to all SC 4 standards; others apply to specific series. The ISO/IEC Directives Part 2 and these supplementary directives provide the set of rules for creating an SC 4 standard.

This document uses the following conventions to delineate text that is to be included in an SC 4 standard (boilerplate) from the rest of the text.

* Examples of required text, as shown below, are enclosed in a light-yellow box (see <<scls_5-3>> for implementing the required text).

[%unnumbered]
----
lorem ipsum …
----

* Information that is to be supplied by the project editor is specified within angle brackets (< … >).

[example]
`<list of in-scope elements>`

* Examples that show specific formats or layouts to be used in SC 4 standards, as shown below, are distinguished from other text by a light green background.

[%unnumbered]
----
lorem ipsum …

This document conforms to its own requirements where they are applicable. However, the format and layout of this document are not intended to be a model for the format and layout of an SC 4 standard; where there is any discrepancy between the text of this document and its format and layout, the text has precedence.

[[cls_1]]

* ISO 8000, _Data quality;_
* ISO 10303, _Product data representation and exchange;_
* ISO 13584, _Parts library;_
* ISO 14306, _JT file format specification for 3D visualization;_
* ISO 15531, _Industrial manufacturing management data;_
* ISO 15926, _Integration of life-cycle data for process plants including oil and gas production facilities;_
* ISO/PAS 17506, _COLLADA digital asset schema specification for 3D visualization of industrial data;_
* ISO 18629, _Process specification language;_
* ISO 18828, _Standardized procedures for production systems engineering;_
* ISO 18876, _Integration of industrial data for exchange, access, and sharing;_

* ISO 22745, _Open technical dictionaries and their application to master data;_
* ISO 23247, _Digital twin framework for manufacturing;_
* ISO 23301, _STEP geometry services;_
* ISO 23952, _Quality information framework, QIF;_
* ISO 24464, _Visualization elements of digital twins;_
* ISO 29002, _Exchange of characteristic data._

This document specifies the elements that make up SC 4 standards, identifies the location and mechanism for the wording to be used to prepare those elements, and sets out rules for the appearance of those elements when these have not already being defined in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018 or by any other SC 4 standing document.

NOTE: In this document, "SC 4 standards" refers to any of the deliverables of SC 4 projects that are published by ISO. These include International Standards, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, and Technical Reports. As Technical Reports are informative and cannot contain requirements, the required text has to be adapted as appropriate.

The following are within the scope of this document:

* specification of rules and guidelines that apply to normative elements;
* specification of rules and guidelines that apply to informative elements;
* guidelines for formatting the elements of the standard.

The following is outside the scope of this document:

* requirements on the technical content of SC 4 standards.

NOTE: An integral part of the repository's XML vocabulary is its representation of EXPRESS language constructs, i.e. its EXPRESS model. This specification shall refer to this EXPRESS model portion of the repository's XML vocabulary as STEPmod EXPRESS. The STEPmod Specification Reference is available at http://stepmod.sourceforge.net/express_model_spec/

[[STEPlib]]
==== STEPlib

data and tools needed for the development and publication of the components of the STEP Extended architecture

[NOTE]
====
STEPlib allows users to:

* manage the SysML models during the development of the models;
* prepare content to be fed into STEPmod: AntPub;
* implement the SysML to XSD binding: AntImp;
* transform the ARM EXPRESS model into the ARM-in-SysML model in order build the SysML mappings from SysML models to EXPRESS models: Reeper;
* check the quality of the SysML source content: CheckXMI.

STEPlib does not deprecate STEPmod. The EXPRESS-based modular STEP development is still managed by STEPmod and the WG12 Bugzilla server. This document assumes that STEPmod is a stable development and publication environment.

STEPlib has the sole purpose of managing the development of the models and producing the associated documentation subsets which will be assembled in STEPmod for ISO publication.

STEPlib is also the name of the top-level model of the SysML model tree used for all the STEP APs.

== Characteristics of an SC 4 standard

A standard communicates a technical specification to identified target users.

ISO requires such specifications to be unambiguous to the extent that any pair of those users can create mutually consistent implementations even when those users

* have not taken part in developing the standard, and
* are not working together.

In the case of many SC 4 standards, those implementations will be software applications that conform to the stated requirements of the standard.

Producing a standard involves developing drafts that satisfy requirements of technical accuracy and that communicate all necessary information to intended users.

Project teams are responsible for developing a standard that matches the scope of a balloted new work item proposal. The team produces drafts of the standard and revises them based on industry reviews, ballot results, and ballot comments. <<fig1>> summarizes team activities to produce a standard. Several levels of reviews happen before the document goes for balloting:

* internal project reviews;
* reviews by industry sponsors and participants;
* "wide industry reviews" (previously referred to as Committee Draft for Comment);
* peer review by other experts in the same Working Group.

[[fig1]]
.An overview of creating a standard
image::img01.png[]

Developers of an SC 4 standard should note that their work is driven by the needs of two different target audiences: end-users in industry who formulate and validate the problems and requirements that SC 4 standards address; and information technology providers who implement the standards and deliver solutions to end-users (see <<fig2>>).

[[fig2]]
.Interaction between end-users, standards developers, and IT providers
image::img02.png[]

The following points summarize key factors that project teams should take into account when preparing a draft standard.

* Treat writing the draft as a process that involves a series of recursive steps (preparing and planning, researching, organizing, drafting, and revising).
* Treat the user profile as the driving force behind all writing decisions.
* Understand what the user needs to know.
* Help the user understand the material through definitions, visuals, writing style, reduction of ambiguities and informative content such as notes and examples.
* Know what the users will do or what the team wants the users to do with the material.
* Ask that there be as many reviews for clarity of communication as there are for technical content.

== Requirements for the structure and content of parts of SC 4 standards

[[scls_5-1]]
=== General

For all the standards of the ISO/TC 184/SC 4 subcommittee the following documents provide applicable requirements:

* the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018, Principles and rules for the structure and drafting of ISO and IEC documents;
* the ISO Simple template.

In addition the exceptions listed in <<scls_5-4>> apply.

For the ISO 8000 series special requirements are given in <<cls_7>>.

For the ISO 10303 series special requirements are given in <<cls_8>>.

For the ISO 15926 series special requirements are given in <<cls_9>>.

For the ISO 18876 series special requirements are given in <<cls_10>>.

To help you, drafting standards resources are available at https://www.iso.org/draftingstandards.html.

NOTE: In these resources, the "Rice Model" is a useful example of how to structure the content of international standards but the detailed wording is not up to date. ISO requires editors always to use boilerplate wording from the latest version of the ISO Simple template (https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/properties/17851245), which is periodically revised.

[[scls_5-2]]
=== Checklists and approval procedures

This document specifies requirements that apply to the standards developed within SC 4. In order to confirm that each SC 4 standard submitted for ballot or publication satisfies the relevant requirements of this and other standing documents, SC 4 has approved a review and approval procedure. This procedure is specified in the SC 4 Quality Manual and includes requirements for the completion of the following checklists.

* The internal review checklist is used by a member of the project team (preferably not the project leader or the project editor) to check the document against the detailed requirements that apply to it. These requirements include those specified in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018, those specified in this document, and if any, those specified in any SC 4 standing document applicable to a series (e.g. ISO 10303).
* The project leader approval checklist is used by the project leader to check the document against a subset of the requirements that apply to it.
* The convener approval checklist is used by the convener of the working group to which the project is assigned to check the document against the main requirements that apply to it.

The "review and approval procedure" requires that the completed checklists are published (as working group N-numbered documents) and that both the project leader and the convenor have indicated their approval of the document before it can be submitted for ballot or publication.

Updated versions of the checklists are available from the following URL: https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=11568437&objAction=browse&viewType=1

Any issues or questions regarding the checklists shall be reported to the SC 4 Quality Committee.

[[scls_5-3]]
=== Required text

Many of the elements in SC 4 standards require specific wording, called required text or boilerplate text.

The repository is located under [GIT ISO URL]/projects/ISOTC184SC4/repos/boilerplate.

The required text is placed as fragments and is maintained to keep alignment with the ISO Directives (updated and validated using the change management process of ISO/TC 184/SC 4).

The required text is between two parts:

the first part consists of:

* the name of the folder where the boilerplate text is defined;
* the identifier that is enclosed between the ":" and the final "]".

the second part is [end_folder].

The light-yellow box below shows, with a "*_lorem ipsum_*" example, how we present the required text in this document.

[%unnumbered]
----
[General:SC4_xxxx]

lorem ipsum ...

[end_General]
----

Therefore, the required text shown in this document is included as an example, only for illustration.

Each working group is responsible for the management of the required text specific to the series of standards under their control.

The SC 4 Quality Committee is responsible for maintaining the repository.

=== SC 4 exceptions

[[scls_5-4-1]]
==== Subdivision of the subject matter within an individual document

<<table1>> lists the elements that comprise the content of SC 4 standards. The bolded elements differ from the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018; the introduction is a mandatory element for all the SC 4 standards and an index is provided as appropriate.

For non-HTML documents, the final cover page is generated by the ISO Central Secretariat.

[[table1]]
.Overview of the major subdivisions of a document and their arrangement in the

h| Index h| Optional
|===

[[scls_5-4-2]]
==== Language versions

SC 4 has agreed with ISO Central Secretariat that the parts of each SC 4 standard is prepared and published only in the English language.

NOTE: Translation of SC 4 standards into other languages is not recommended. National bodies wishing to translate SC 4 standards into other languages for publication should base the translation on the corrected proof of the English language edition.

[[scls_5-4-3]]
==== Index (optional)

An index, the final element of a standard, is an alphabetical list of the terms defined in the main text and the major topics discussed in the main text.

NOTE: The index is not an annex. It is an additional informative element that is the last element in the standard.

The index shall include an entry for each term that is defined in <<cls_3>> of the document. The entry cites each page where the definition or topic occurs. The index enables readers to find information quickly and easily.

The integrated resources (see <<scls_8-2-6>>) and application protocol series <<guidelines>> of ISO 10303 have specific requirements for the index. The index shall not contain EXPRESS attribute names. Where there is a sufficient requirement, other terms that readers of the document would need to find in the index, may be included.

The key to compiling a good index is selectivity. Instead of listing every possible reference to a term or a topic, select references to the formal definition of the term or to the clause, subclause, or paragraph where the topic is discussed fully or where a significant point is made about it. For index entries, chose words or phrases that best represent a topic. Key terms are those that a reader would most likely look for in an index.

NOTE: See ISO 999 <<iso999>> and The Handbook of Technical Writing <<alred>> for further information about creating an index.

If the index is present then the terms defined in <<cls_3>> (Terms and definitions) of the standard shall be listed in the index.

In the "Table of contents", the index shall appear after the bibliography.

[[scls_5-4-4]]
==== Use of ASN.1 Identifiers in SC 4 standards (optional)

[[scls_5-4-4-1]]
===== Information object registration annex

Some SC 4 standards can have an "Information object registration annex". This annex defines the information object identifier for the standard as specified by ISO/IEC 8824-1 <<iso8824>>. As a consequence, the SC 4 standard shall specify a reference to ISO/IEC 8824-1.

The status of the annex, in which the information object registration is specified, varies according to its referencing within the text.

The structure of the annex, in which the information object registration is specified, varies according to the nature of the standard.

NOTE: In ISO 10303 this annex is the last normative annex.

In a SC 4 standard that includes one or more schemas, the annex has two subclauses: Document identification and Schema identification. In a standard that does not include schemas, there is no subdivision; the content of the annex corresponds to that of the Document identification subclause in the first case.

The complete mechanism of the information object registration is described in ISO/DIS 10303-1:2020 Clause 7 Information object registration scheme.

A tutorial on the ASN.1 identifier is provided in <<annexA>>.

[[scls_5-4-4-2]]
===== Document identification

An example of the text to introduce the document identification for standards prepared by SC 4 reads as follows, see <<scls_5-3>> for implementing the required text.

[%unnumbered]
----
[General:SC4_annex_obj_reg-d]

To provide for unambiguous identification of an information object in an open system, the object identifier

{iso standard 8000 part(065) version(1)}

is assigned to this document. The meaning of this value is defined in ISO/IEC 8824-1, and is described in ISO 10303-1.

[end_General]
----

[[scls_5-4-4-3]]
===== Schema identification

For the SC 4 standards that define schemas or include an electronic insert, include a subclause titled "Schema identification" within the information object registration annex. If the standard includes more than one schema or electronic insert then further subdivide this subclause such that each subdivision identifies one schema or one electronic insert. Order these subclauses in the same sequence as the schemas themselves. If the standard includes only one schema then use the text given below within the "Schema identification" subclause.

An example of text is provided below:

[%unnumbered]
----
[General:SC4_annex_obj_reg-s]

To provide for unambiguous identification of the schema-name in an open information system, the object identifier

{iso standard 10303 part(42) version(10) object(1) topology-schema(2)}

is assigned to the topology-schema schema. The meaning of this value is defined in ISO/IEC 8824-1, and is described in ISO 10303-1.

[end_General]
----

[[scls_5-4-5]]
==== Computer sorting

Rules for alphabetical ordering are found in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018 in the Clause 17, Symbols and abbreviated terms.

These rules for alphabetical order are not suitable for computer sorting of declaration identifiers in a schema.

Each declaration identifier name that is the concatenation of a series of words, with or without a separator, shall be sorted as if each name in the series of words were separate words.

The preferred types of separator are none, or underscore '_'. Separator of hyphen '-' may be used when no separator or underscore separator are not suitable. When no separator is used, each word shall start with an uppercase letter. Only one type of separator shall be used in a schema.

NOTE: This is to ensure different types of concatenation result in the same order when computer sorted.

[example]
The entity type ConditionRelationship and Condition_relationship use different types of concatenation.

[example]
The entity types Condition_parameter, Condition_relationship, Conditional_configuration, and Conditional_effectivity are in the correct sorting order. The entity types ConditionParameter, ConditionRelationship, ConditionalConfiguration, and ConditionalEffectivity are in the correct sorting order.

[[scls_5-5]]
=== Other topics of importance to SC 4 standards

NOTE: The complete matrix presentation of project simplified diagram of options is available in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO Supplement, 2020, Annex F

Editors shall always check publication dates with the SC 4 Secretariat. Documents submitted to ISO CS after 15 September may have to be dated for the following year.

Each document relating to the work of an ISO technical committee or subcommittee circulated to all or some of the member bodies shall have a "N-number". The N-number is made up of the following two parts separated by the letter N:

* the number of the technical committee (TC) and, when applicable, the number of the subcommittee (SC) to which the working document belongs;
* an overall serial number.

[example]
The N-number of this document is: ISO/TC 184/SC 4 N3554 (where 3554 is the latest number of the document).

[[scls_5-5-2]]
==== Table of contents

The following rules apply for the table of contents:

* terminological entries are not included in the table of contents;
* subdivisions of annexes are not included in the table of contents;
* for the non-HTML documents, tables of figures, tables, equations, formulae, parts are not included in the table of contents.

[[scls_5-5-3]]
==== Patent rights

A published document for which patent rights have been identified during the preparation thereof, shall include a notice in the introduction (see <<isodir2, clause "30">>).

The patent right statement is given in the ISO simple template and in the version-controlled repository of ISO/TC 184/SC 4. ([GIT ISO URL]/projects/ISOTC184SC4/repos/boilerplate/browse/ISO/ISO_patentRightStatement.txt)

The generic statement in the Foreword needs to be retained whether or not there is an additional statement about identified patents in the Introduction.

[[scls_5-5-4]]
==== Scope

The scope clause shall begin immediately after the title element.

The scope clause should be less than one page long.

NOTE: Scope is covered by the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018, clause 14

For all the normative SC 4 standards the scope clause shall start with a specific wording. Examples are shown as follows (see <<scls_5-3>> for implementing the required text).

[%unnumbered]
----
[General:SC4_Scope_scope-1]

- the methods used for the creation of identifiers;
- the syntax of the query and of the response used in the resolution of identifiers;
- the methods used for the resolution of identifiers.
----

[[scls_5-5-5]]
==== Terms and definitions clause

[[scls_5-5-5-1]]
===== General

Definitions of terms are required to conform to the provisions of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018, clause 16 and of ISO 10241-1:2011 <<iso10241>>. Additional recommended practices from _A Concise Introduction to Logic_ by Patrick J. Hurley <<hurley>> are given in <<annexB>> of this document.

[[scls_5-5-5-2]]
===== Note to a terminological entry

A note to a terminological entry (referred to as "Note # to entry") follows different rules from a note ("NOTE #") integrated in the text. It provides additional information that supplements the terminological data, such as:

* provisions (statements, instructions, recommendations or requirements) relating to the use of a term,
* information regarding the units applicable to a quantity, or
* an explanation of the reasons for selecting an abbreviated form as the preferred term.

Notes to entry shall be numbered starting with "1" within each terminological entry. A single note to entry shall be numbered.


[[scls_5-5-5-3]]
===== References in a terminological entry

The source references for individual entries are informative and are listed in the Bibliography.

[example]
====
[%unnumbered]
----
data element
unit of data that is considered in context to be indivisible
[SOURCE: ISO/IEC 11179-1:2015, 3.3.8]
----
====

[[scls_5-5-5-4]]
===== Using all terms and definitions from another standard

The source references cited in the introductory sentence of <<cls_3>> such as " For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in ISO #### apply ", are considered to be normative and are listed in <<cls_2>>.

[example]
For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in ISO 8000-2 and the following apply.


[[scls_5-5-6]]
==== Symbols and abbreviated terms

An example of the wording to use to introduce this element is provided below, see <<scls_5-3>> for implementing the required text.

[%unnumbered]
----
[General: SC4_symbols]

For the purposes of this document, the following symbols apply:

or [General: SC4_abbreviatedTerms]

For the purposes of this document, the following abbreviated terms apply:

or [General: SC4_symbols_abbreviatedTerms]

For the purposes of this document, the following symbols and abbreviated terms apply:

[end_General]
----

The symbols and abbreviated terms shall be given in two left-justified columns, using normal style, without punctuation (except as part of the abbreviated term or the explanation of the symbol). Capitalization shall correspond to the use of the abbreviation. The right column shall contain the phrase corresponding to the symbol or abbreviated term. See <<scls_3-5>> of this document for an example of an abbreviated terms subclause.

The following abbreviated terms may be used in the text without definition; do not list these abbreviations.

* ISO;
* IEC.

[[scls_5-5-7]]
==== References to subdivisions of the text

In addition to the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018, 22.4, use "Clause" only to refer to an entire clause. Do not use the words "subclause" or "reference". Use the following forms:

* "in accordance with Clause 3";
* "according to 3.1";
* "details as given in 3.1.1";
* "(see 3.1.1)";
* "as described in 3.1.2";
* "see Annex B".

[[scls_5-5-8]]
==== Punctuation of words in a series

SC 4 recommends adding a comma in a series for clarity. Officially this serial comma (also called an Oxford comma or a Harvard comma) is considered optional, but using it consistently is easier for international writers. This comma is placed immediately before the coordinating conjunction (usually and or or) in a series of three or more terms.

[example]
The following sentence is an example of this type of punctuation. "In the United States, dogwood, cherry, and redbud are three types of trees that bloom in the spring."

[[scls_5-5-9]]
==== Avoid abbreviations

Do not use "i.e." and "e.g.". Instead, use the EXAMPLE format.

Likewise, do not use "etc.". End the series prior to the "etc." being certain to use a serial comma before the "and" (added if not already there). To state that the series is incomplete, use "such as" at the start of the series.

[[scls_5-5-10]]
==== Landscape

Use of landscape mode for figures and tables in SC 4 standards is deprecated with the following exceptions:

* all large size diagrams.

[[scls_5-5-11]]
==== Spelling, hyphenation, words to avoid and frequently used words

These topics, as they are frequently updated, will be managed within the checklists (see <<scls_5-2>>).

[[cls_6]]
== EXPRESS presentation style

[[scls_6-1]]
=== General

This clause gives rules and guidelines specific to documenting EXPRESS. The subjects covered are as follows.

* Layout: explains how to use indentation, blank lines, and other white space to produce a consistent layout (see <<scls_6-2>>).
* Expression: provides guidance for how to layout the various expressions in EXPRESS. (see <<scls_6-3>>).
* Statements: provides guidance for how to layout the various statements in EXPRESS. (see <<scls_6-4>>).
* Style: deals with naming conventions that are to be used for all schemas developed for SC 4 standards (see <<scls_6-5>>).
* Usage: defines rules for the use of EXPRESS language elements in SC 4 standards (see <<scls_6-6>>).

NOTE: See also the Guidelines for application interpreted model development <<guidelines532>>, the Procedures for application interpretation <<barnard>>, and Syntactic and semantic rules <<step>> for further guidance on the use of EXPRESS in ISO 10303.

* Documentation requirements for definitions of EXPRESS schemas (see <<scls_6-7>>).
* The layout and format to be used for EXPRESS-G diagrams (see <<scls_6-8>>).
* Examples are provided in <<scls_6-9>>.
* The following convention is used to display EXPRESS examples:

[%unnumbered]
----
EXAMPLE;
   first : INTEGER;
   second : STRING;
END_EXAMPLE;
----

[[scls_6-2]]
=== Layout rules

The layout rules explain how to use white space to produce a schema that has a uniform appearance. A uniform appearance helps the reader to find and use the material of interest.

To prevent unusual spacing, use left justification for EXPRESS language statements, not full justification.

Because of the variability of the size of EXPRESS declarations, no hard rule can be given for the number of lines to force on one page. Do not insert extra page breaks.

[[scls_6-2-1]]
==== Organization of the schema elements

Schema elements shall be written in the order specified in <<table3>>. None of these elements are mandatory; only include these elements as needed (see also <<scls_6-7>>).

[[table3]]
.Order of declarations of schema elements
|===
h| Declaration type h| EXPRESS keyword
| Interface statements | USE FROM or REFERENCE FROM
| Constants | CONSTANT
| Types | TYPE
| Entity data types | ENTITY
| Subtype constraints | SUBTYPE_CONSTRAINT
| Functions | FUNCTION
| Rule | RULE
| Procedure | PROCEDURE
|===

[[scls_6-2-2]]
==== Use of the colon

When used in an attribute declaration, at least one space shall be placed before the colon that follows the attribute identifier. One space shall be placed between the colon and the identifier that specifies the domain of the attribute. When there is more than one attribute declaration within an entity data type declaration, additional space can be used between the attribute identifier and the colon to align the colons in tabular fashion, when possible.

[example]
====
The following example illustrates alignment of the colons in attribute declarations:

[%unnumbered]
----
ENTITY e1;
   first : INTEGER;
   second : STRING;
END_ENTITY;
----
====

When used in a label, no space shall separate the label name from the colon.

[example]
====
The following example illustrates the placement of colons in labels:

[%unnumbered]
----
ENTITY e2;
   first : INTEGER;
   second : STRING;
UNIQUE
   UR1: second;
WHERE
   WR1: first > 5;
END_ENTITY;
----
====

[[scls_6-2-3]]
==== Use of the semicolon

A space shall not appear before a semicolon, and a semicolon shall not appear at the beginning of a line.

[example]
====
The following example illustrates correct placement of semicolons:

[%unnumbered]
----
ENTITY e1;
   first : INTEGER;
   second : STRING;
END_ENTITY;
-----
====

[example]

The following example illustrates incorrect placement of semicolons:

[%unnumbered]
----
ENTITY e1 ;
   first : INTEGER
;
   second : STRING
;END_ENTITY       ;
----
====

[[scls_6-2-4]]
==== Commenting conventions

It should be possible to extract an EXPRESS data specification (one or more schema declarations) defined in an SC 4 standard from the source description of the part of ISO 10303 by regarding all material that is not part of the EXPRESS declarations as comments. Accordingly, EXPRESS declarations shall be separated from the surrounding text by EXPRESS embedded remark markers ("(*" and "*)"). The closing marker shall appear by itself on the line immediately preceding the EXPRESS object description, and the opening marker shall appear by itself on the line immediately following the description of the EXPRESS object.

[example]
====
The following example illustrates the use of embedded remark markers:

[%unnumbered]
----
*)
ENTITY e1;
   first : INTEGER;
   second : STRING;
END_ENTITY;
(*
----
====

NOTE: This implies that to process the complete document as EXPRESS, it may be necessary to add one opening marker at the beginning of the document and one closing marker at the end of the document.

Material not intended to describe a requirement, such as examples or notes that include EXPRESS code, shall not use the "`*)`" and "`(*`" delimiters.

Tail remarks (`-- text`) shall be used to indicate the source of a schema that is specified in an interface statement.

[example]
====
The following example illustrates the use of tail remarks in interface statements:

[%unnumbered]
----
USE FROM schema1 (e1, e2); -- ISO sssss-ppp
----
====

Tail remarks may also be used to annotate portions of the code of an EXPRESS PROCEDURE or FUNCTION. The functionality of algorithms may be explained by this method.

[example]
====
The following example illustrates the use of remark tags:

[%unnumbered]
----
*)
ENTITY ent;
   attr : INTEGER;
END_ENTITY;
(*"ent.attr" The attr attribute…………*)
----
====

The tagged remark in the example above refers to the attribute `attr` in the scope of `ent`.

[[scls_6-2-5]]
==== Indentation

Use indentation to achieve a consistent layout for EXPRESS declarations. In the requirements that follow, minimum requirements for indentation are stated; the same indentation should be used within one SC 4 standard.

[[scls_6-2-6]]
==== Layout of a schema

The SCHEMA and END_SCHEMA keywords shall be flush with the left margin. Contained objects shall also have the begin and end keywords flush with the left margin. The SCHEMA keyword shall be on a line immediately after the File header content.

Interface clauses begin flush with the left margin.

[example]
====
The following example illustrates the layout of schema, type, and entity data type declarations:

[%unnumbered]
----
SCHEMA schema_name;
USE FROM schema2;
TYPE type1;
END_TYPE;
ENTITY entity1;
END_ENTITY;
END_SCHEMA;
----
====

[[scls_6-2-7]]
==== Layout of interface statements

An interface begins with the *USE FROM* or *REFERENCE FROM* keywords at the left margin. Followed by the name of the SCHEMA being interfaced.

Optionally, there can be a list of object names that are interfaced from the specified schema. If this list is present, it will begin on the following line with the open parenthesis positioned two characters to the right of the left margin. Each item in the list is written to a line by itself with the first one being written just after the open parenthesis. The items are separated by a comma. Each subsequent item will be aligned with the one above it. The final item will have the close parenthesis following immediately after it.

Finally, the interface specification is terminated by a semicolon.

The source document for the interface shall be provided as a trailing comment immediately after the name of the interfaced schema. If the version of the schema is available in the source document, it shall be provided in the output.

[example]
====
The following examples illustrates the layout of *USE FROM* interface statements:

[%unnumbered]
----
SCHEMA schema3 ’iso standard 10303 part(nn) version(yy)
object(1)geometric_model_schema(3)’;
USE FROM schema1 -- ISO 10303-42 schema1 version 10

==== Layout of a constant declaration

The *CONSTANT* keyword is on a line by itself and flush with the left margin of the enclosing declaration.

On each following line is a constant specification. Indented two characters to the right of the start of the *CONSTANT* keyword is the name of the constant followed by a colon :) followed by the declared type of the constant followed by an assignment operator (:=) followed by an expression which calculates the value for the constant followed by a semicolon (;) to terminate the constant definition.

All of the colons separating the constant name from the constant type can be aligned. There should be at least one space before and after this colon.

All of the colons that are part of the assignment operator which separates the constant type from the initialization expression should be aligned. There should be at least one space before and after the assignment operator.

==== TYPE layout

The TYPE and END TYPE keywords are flush with the left margin and each on its own line.

Immediately after the *TYPE* keyword is the name of the type, an equal sign (’=’) and the underlying type. If the underlying type is either an ENUMERATION or a SELECT and all of the values will not fit on one line, then the list begins on the next line indented two characters and each value will be written on its own line.

If present, the *WHERE* keyword is flush with the left margin. The individual where rules are indented two characters to the right.

[example]

If there is a *SUBTYPE OF* specification, it is specified next beginning on the next line, indented two characters to the right of the left margin.

Next is a semicolon to mark the end of the entity header.

The attributes are next with each one on a line by itself, indented two characters to the right of the left margin. The colons that separate the attribute name from the attribute type should be aligned with at least one space before and after the colon.

If there are any derived attributes, they are written next. The *DERIVE* keyword is written on a line by itself flush with the left margin. Each attribute is written on a line by itself indented two characters to the right of the left margin. The colons that separate the attribute name from the attribute type should be aligned and have at least one space before and after. The colons in the assignment operator should be aligned with at least one space before and after the assignment operator. Each attribute should end with a semicolon.

If there are any inverse attributes, they are written next. The *INVERSE* keyword is written on a line by itself, flush with the left margin. Each attribute is written on a line by itself, indented two characters to the right of the left margin.

An inverse attribute has a name followed by a colon and the type of the attribute. The attribute type has an optional *SET* or *BAG* aggregate specification which consists of either the *SET* or *BAG* keyword followed by an optional bounds specification, followed by the *OF* keyword and then the name of an *ENTITY*, followed by the *FOR* keyword and the specification of the attribute being inverted. The colons between the attribute name and type should be aligned and have at least one space before and after.

If there are any unique rules, they are written next. The *UNIQUE* keyword is written on a line by itself, flush with the left margin. Each unique rule is written on a line by itself, indented two characters to the right of the left margin.

If there are any local rules, they are written next. The *WHERE* keyword is written on a line by itself, flush with the left margin. Each local rule is written on a line by itself, indented two characters to the right of the left margin.

===== FUNCTION

The *FUNCTION* and *END FUNCTION* keywords are on separate lines and aligned with the left margin. Immediately, following the *FUNCTION* keyword is a space followed by the name of the function.

Immediately after the function name, without a space, is the open parenthesis that marks the beginning of the formal parameters. Each parameter is written on a line by itself with the first one being written on the same line as the open parenthesis with no space between it and the parenthesis.

A semicolon separates each of the formal parameters and is flush against the parameter that it comes after.

After the final formal parameter, is a close parenthesis followed by a colon and then the type for the value that is returned from the function. The colon should have at least one space before and after it. After the return type is a semicolon which marks the end of the function header.

If there are any local *ENTITY*, *SUBTYPE CONSTRAINT*, *FUNCTION*, *RULE*, *PROCEDURE*, or *TYPE* declarations, they are written next, indented two characters to the right of the left margin.

If there are any *CONSTANT* declarations, they are written next. The *CONSTANT* and *END CONSTANT* keywords are written on separate lines, flush with the left margin. Each constant is written on a separate line indented two characters to the right of the left margin.

A comma separates each entity name and is positioned flush against the entity name it follows.

After the final entity name is a close parenthesis followed by a semicolon.

If there are any local *ENTITY*, *SUBTYPE CONSTRAINT*, *FUNCTION*, *RULE*, *PROCEDURE*, or *TYPE* declarations, they are written next, indented two characters to the right of the left margin.

IF there are any *CONSTANT* declarations, they are written next. The *CONSTANT* and *END CONSTANT* keywords are written on separate lines, flush with the left margin. Each constant is written on a separate line indented two characters to the right of the left margin.

=== Style rules

These style rules specify capitalization and choosing and using names for objects in a schema. Except for attribute names, EXPRESS identifiers shall be unique across all parts of ISO 10303.

NOTE: The namespace for unique identifiers extends to parts of other SC 4 standards that are deemed to be "common resources".

[[scls_6-5-1]]
==== Use of case

EXPRESS reserved words shall be written in upper case letters; everything else should be written in lower case.

A special use of case applies for ISO 10303 ARM application objects. Names of 10303 ARM application objects shall have the first letter be in uppercase.

[[scls_6-5-2]]
==== Names

An EXPRESS schema may use a large number of identifiers. Because these identifiers are very suggestive, clarity, avoidance of ambiguity, similarity, and uniqueness are important considerations in choosing an identifier name. The names chosen for EXPRESS elements should reflect the meaning of the element and should complement the natural language definition of the element. However, names should not be a substitute for a definition, or repeat the definition. Obviously, names should not conflict with or contradict the definition of the element.

The following general rules apply to naming of elements in an EXPRESS schema.

* Avoid confusion with similar names in the immediate context.
* Use the shortest possible names. Do not use prefixes and suffixes such as is_, a_, the_, _set, _array, and _list.
* Use plural name forms for aggregates;
* Use nouns or noun phrases for names of types, entity data types, and attributes that will appear in an EXPRESS long form;
* Use verbs or verb phrases for names of actions; and
* Separate name components by underscores.

[[scls_6-5-2-1]]
===== Names of types

The name chosen for a type should reflect the nature of the type.

If the type defines a constraint on a base type, the name should reflect the constraint.

[example]
A type whose base type is `INTEGER` and that constrains the domain to be even numbers is named "even_number".

If the type is intended to add meaning to a base type, the name should reflect the meaning.

[example]
A type whose base type is `STRING` and is intended to be used to identify types of part is named "part_identifier".

A select type should be named in terms of the role that the different members of the type can play.

[example]
A select type whose domain is the entity data types *person* and *organization* and indicates that a person or an organization can own something is named "owner".

NOTE: The suffix "_select" may be included in the name of a select type if this suffix helps to disambiguate the type from other EXPRESS elements in a given schema or collection of schemas.

NOTE: Particular conventions apply to the naming of select types that are used in completion of the management resource templates in ISO 10303-41 <<iso10303-41>>. These select types are named by combining a word or phrase that stands for the administrative concept that is associated with product data and the suffix "_item".

[example]
A select type whose domain is the set of entity data types with which an approval can be assigned is named "approval_item".

The names used of an enumeration data type shall be distinct from the names of schemas, entity data types, and types. It is often appropriate for these to be adjectival; for example, use "planar" rather than "plane" as the name of an enumeration data type. However, different enumeration types may contain the same name.

[[scls_6-5-2-2]]
===== Names of entity data types

The name chosen for an entity data type should reflect the class of "real world" objects or concepts that the entity data type represents. The name should make use of accepted terminology in the field supported by the schema in which the entity data type is defined.

NOTE: This approach is not always feasible in generic schemas (such as the ISO 10303 integrated resources) that are intended to support a wide range of fields. In this case it is important to choose a name that is neutral with respect to the possible applications of the entity data type, and to provide a definition that accurately convey the generic meaning of the entity data type.

Do not prefix entity data type names with definite or indefinite articles "the_" or "a_".

[example]
An entity data type that represents documents should be named "document", not "the_document" or "a_document".

Entity data type names should be singular, not plural.

[example]
An entity data type that represents documents should be named "document", not "documents".

The name of an entity data type may reflect the name of other entity data types to which it is related in a subtype/supertype hierarchy. The name may reflect the following:

* how a subtype differs from its supertype;
* how one subtype differs from other subtypes (of a common supertype).

In an ISO 10303 integrated resource, the name of a subtype should reflect the specialized meaning or intended usage of the subtype.

[example]
ISO 10303-41 defines an entity data type named *product_definition_relationship* that represents associations between instances of the *product_definition* entity data type. A subtype of *product_definition_relationship* defined in ISO 10303-44 specializes its meaning such that one of the related instances of *product_definition* represents a component in an assembly that is represented by the other instance of *product_definition*. The name of this subtype is *assembly_component_usage*.

In the application interpreted model of an ISO 10303 application protocol, or a module interpreted module, the name of a subtype of an entity data type defined in the integrated resources may reflect the usage of the resource construct in the application protocol or module.

Do not use the schema name as the prefix to an entity data type name: entity data type *unit* of schema *x* is referred to as *x.unit* from another schema. However, it is sometimes necessary to use the name of a supertype as a suffix for subtype entity data types.

[example]
The suffixes "_curve" and "_surface" are necessary in the entity data type names *b_spline_curve* and *b_spline_surface* because "b_spline" alone would cause a name clash.

In a like manner, the name of a supertype sometimes is useful as a prefix to a subtype name.

[example]
The supertype name is used as a prefix in the name of the entity data type *surface_of_revolution*.

[[scls_6-5-2-3]]
===== Names of attributes

The name chosen for an attribute should reflect the role that the domain of the referenced type plays in the entity data type in which the attribute is declared. Use singular names for single-valued attributes. Use a plural name for an attribute whose domain is an aggregate.

Do not use the entity data type name as a prefix of an attribute name. Attribute *test* of entity *x* is referred to as *x.test* from outside scope of that entity data type.

Do not append "_set", "_array", "_bag", or "_list" to an attribute type.

[example]
Use "knots" instead of "knot_array".

Do not use the type name as the attribute name even though EXPRESS allows it. The attribute name should reflect the role the type is playing in the definition of the entity data type.

[[scls_6-5-2-4]]
===== Names of rules, functions, and procedures

When choosing a name, the use that will be read most often takes priority. For example, the executable code of a function will not be reviewed very often, but the function name will be. Consequently, the name should read naturally in a domain (`WHERE`) rule rather than following the keyword `FUNCTION`. The choice does not depend on which happens to be written first: the one containing its use or the one containing its declaration. For the purposes of choosing a name, the use takes precedence.

For example, rather than using

[%unnumbered]
----
FUNCTION is_extension_supplied ()
----

whose invocation would be

[%unnumbered]
----
IF is_extension_supplied ( ) THEN
----

the "is_" prefix should be removed, allowing the call to be read as a phrase in English as well as in EXPRESS. In this case, the function declaration should be

[%unnumbered]
----
FUNCTION extension_supplied ()
----

so that its invocation is

[%unnumbered]
----
IF extension_supplied ( ) THEN
----

[[scls_6-5-2-5]]
===== Clashes of attribute and function names

Attributes shall not have the same names as functions; such name conflicts are confusing in domain rules.


[[scls_6-5-2-6]]
===== Length of names

Although EXPRESS schemas are published as digital files, the documentation of the schema shall conform to publishing requirements based on the rules and guidelines for page size and fonts specified in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018. In order to avoid line breaks in EXPRESS identifiers, there is a practical limit of 60 characters on the names used for EXPRESS elements. Although such long names should be avoided, conventions for naming of entity data types and rules can produce names that exceed this limit. In this case abbreviations may be used.

[example]
Some SC 4 projects use a convention for naming rules that combines the name of the entity data type that is constrained by the rule with a phrase that describes the constraint applied. This convention can lead to very long names, such as "product_definition_relationship_requires_primary_classification" (63 characters). To avoid such long names, identifiers of constrained entity data types name may be abbreviated as they are used in rules. In this case, the name "pdr_requires_primary_classification" could be used.

If this approach is adopted, then the following requirements apply:

* the abbreviation shall be used consistently;

[example]
In the example above, all rules in the schema that constrain the product_definition_relationship entity data type should be prefixed "pdr_", not just those whose unabbreviated names would exceed 60 characters.

* the abbreviations shall be defined, and their use explained at the start of the clause or subclause in which the schema is defined.

To define and explain the use of the abbreviated names, an example of the text to use reads as follows, see <<scls_5-3>>. for implementing the required text.

[%unnumbered]
----
[General:SC4_express_abbr]

Abbreviated names are used in the identifiers of the <entity data types, rules, …> declared in this shema. Prefixes used in these identifiers have the following meanings:

<list the abbreviated forms and the full names>

[end_General]
----

[example]
====
The following example illustrates the use of this text:

[%unnumbered]
----
Abbreviated names are used in the identifiers of the rules declared in this schema. Prefixes used in these identifiers have the following meanings:

cgs character_glyph_symbol
pdr product_definition_relationship
pdu product_definition_usage
----
====

[[scls_6-5-2-7]]
===== Abbreviations and acronyms

Abbreviations and acronyms can be confusing so avoid them if possible. When you have to use them (to avoid layout problems), take care to use them consistently and to document the full meaning. When an abbreviation or acronym is used in an EXPRESS declaration, a comment shall be provided within the declaration to give the full spelling.

[[scls_6-6]]
=== EXPRESS usage style requirements

[[scls_6-6-1]]
==== Layout of local domain (WHERE) rules.

Large functions that test several aspects of an entity should not be used. Split the function into several smaller functions.

[example]
====
The following contains one of each of these uses (in the same order):

[%unnumbered]
----
ENTITY line;
   start : point;
   dir : direction;
WHERE
   WR1: arc_length_extent(line) = infinity;
   WR2: coordinate_space(line) = coordinate_space(start);
   WR3: start.x > 0.0;
END_ENTITY;
----
====

[[scls_6-6-2]]
==== Labelling UNIQUE and WHERE rules

Each label within the scope of an entity data type shall not be used by more than one UNIQUE rule within that scope. The form of the label shall be URn where n is an integer giving the position of the rule in the list. The list shall not have any gaps in the sequence from the first entry to the last.

Each label within the scope of an entity data type shall not be used by more than one WHERE rule within that scope. The form of the label shall be WRn where n is an integer giving the position of the rule in the list. The list shall not have any gaps in the sequence from the first entry to the last.

NOTE: Several legacy resources use a short English word for a label. That usage is acceptable only for those existing labels.

[[scls_6-7]]
=== EXPRESS schema documentation

NOTE: Any of the requirements below that only apply to integrated resources are indicated as such.

[[scls_6-7-1]]
==== General requirements

The title of each clause or subclause in which a schema is declared shall be the schema name (without the "_schema" suffix, if this is part of the name), with underscores replaced by spaces, and with the initial character in upper case.

[example]
The title of the clause that documents a schema whose name is "dynamic_fluid_flow" is "Dynamic fluid flow".

For parts of ISO 10303 that are in the integrated resources series, each schema shall be documented in a separate clause.

When referring to the elements of the EXPRESS language, EXPRESS reserved words (such as `SCHEMA`, `ENTITY`, `WHERE`) shall appear as all caps in a monospaced font.

NOTE: Such references in the documentation of a schema should not be necessary, as these words refer to the elements of the language itself.

When referring to elements of the schema, words and phases such as "type", "schema", and "entity data type" shall not be capitalized.

[example]
In text that refers to an entity data type, use the phrase "the <entity data type name> entity data type, not "the <entity data type name> `ENTITY`".

In the documentation of a schema, the same English language words may be used to refer to an object in the real world or to a concept, and as the name of an EXPRESS data type that represents this object or concept. Use the following typographical convention to distinguish between these. If the referent is the object or concept, the word or phrase occurs in the same typeface as narrative text. If the referent is the EXPRESS data type, the word or phrase occurs in a bold typeface. Use bold typeface for the names of EXPRESS schemas, functions, rules, procedures, and attributes of entity data types where they appear in general text.

The name of an EXPRESS data type may be used to refer to the data type itself, or to an instance of the data type. The distinction between these uses is normally clear from the context. If there is a likelihood of ambiguity, the phrase "entity data type" or "instance(s) of" is included in the text.

NOTE: See the SC 4 Quality manual for the procedure for validation of EXPRESS schemas.

[[scls_6-7-2]]
==== Components of a clause that specifies an EXPRESS schema

Each clause that specifies an EXPRESS schema shall contain the following subclauses in the order given below:

[%unnumbered]
----
x   <schema name>
x.1 Introduction
x.2 Fundamental concepts and assumptions
x.3 <schema name> type definitions
x.4 <schema name> entity data type definitions
x.5 <schema name> rule definitions
x.6 <schema name> function definitions
----

If there is nothing contained in one of the subclauses, the subclause shall be omitted, and the remaining subclauses renumbered accordingly.

The subclause containing declarations of entity data types may also be titled "<schema name> entity definitions". If this form is used, it shall be used consistently for all schemas defined in a single standard.

[[scls_6-7-3]]
==== Schema documentation requirements

The following rules shall apply to documenting the schema.

An example of the wording to introduce the schema clause is given below (see <<scls_5-3>>. for implementing the required text).

[%unnumbered]
----
[General:SC4_express_schemaClause]

This clause defines the information requirements to which implementations shall conform using the EXPRESS language as defined in ISO 10303-11. The following EXPRESS declaration begins the <schema name> and identifies the necessary external references.

[end_General]
----

The <schema name> should be replaced by the name of the schema as it appears in the schema declaration. This wording shall appear immediately following the clause heading. If there are no external references, the words "and identifies the necessary external references" shall be omitted.

The above text shall be followed by the schema declaration. The declaration shall include any interface statements (`USE FROM` or `REFERENCE FROM`) necessary for the schema. An example of the required text for the declaration is given below (see <<scls_5-3>>. for implementing the required text).

[%unnumbered]
----
[General:SC4_express_schema-1]

EXPRESS specification:

*)
SCHEMA <schema_1 name>;
REFERENCE FROM <schema_2 name>
  (<e1 name,
   e2 name>);
(*

[end_General]
----

Where interface statements occur, place a note following the schema declaration that identifies the source(s) of the interfaced schema(s). These sources may be any of the following:

* another clause of the same part;
* another part of the same SC 4 standard;
* a different standard.

In the second and third cases the standard in which the interfaced schema is declared shall be listed as a normative reference (see <<isodir2, clause "15">>).

An example of the notes is given below:

[%unnumbered]
----
[General: SC4_express_schema-2]

NOTE X      The schemas referenced above are specified in the following documents:
<schema_1>  Clause <n> of this document
<schema_2>  ISO <ISO standard and part number>
NOTE X      See Annex x for a graphical representation of this schema.

[end_General]
----

The elements of the note are arranged in two left-justified columns, without punctuation. The schema name shall be presented in bold face.

[example]
====
The following example illustrates this type of note:

[%unnumbered]
----
NOTE The schemas referenced above can be found in the following parts of ISO 10303:

product_definition_schema   ISO 10303-41
geometry_schema             ISO 10303-42
representation_schema       ISO 10303-43
----
====

[[scls_6-7-4]]
==== Introduction to schema

The introduction to the schema shall include the objectives of the schema and a description of its major components and key concepts.

This subclause is primarily text but may contain figures, such as an EXPRESS-G diagram that presents an overview of the entity data types contained in the schema. If included, this figure shall be referenced from a note.

An example of the required text to begin the introduction to each schema for schemas defined in integrated resources parts of ISO 10303 is given below (see <<scls_5-3>> for implementing the required text).

[%unnumbered]
----
[ISO_10303:10303_express_schema-3]

The subject of the <schema name> is . . . .

[end_ISO_10303]
----

[[scls_6-7-5]]
==== Fundamental concepts and assumptions

The fundamental concepts and assumptions are declarations of fact about the subject area of the schema. These facts have been used as the basis for developing the integrated resource and are essential to the reader’s understanding and using the standard.

Fundamental concepts and assumptions may be expressed in a general or structured form. The general form shall be text that describes the concepts and assumptions that underlie the schema. The structured form shall be a list formatted as described in <<isodir2, clause "23">>.

Fundamental concepts that apply to the entire standard covering multiple schemas shall be documented in an additional clause immediately following the terms and abbreviations clause. Extra clauses may be included if appropriate to precede collections of related schemas.

[[scls_6-7-6]]
==== Documentation of formal propositions

Formal propositions follow the EXPRESS declaration (types and entity data types), the definition of enumeration items (types only), or argument definitions (rules). Formal propositions are constraints that are computable, are written in EXPRESS, and are placed within the WHERE clause of the declaration of a type, entity data type, or rule. The following rules apply to formal propositions in the documentation of types (see <<scls_6-7-8>>), entity data types (see <<scls_6-7-9>>), or rules (see <<scls_6-7-10>>).

* The formal propositions shall be preceded by the underlined title "Formal propositions:" (<=== this title is to be underlined).

* When there is a local rule label in the EXPRESS specification, each formal proposition shall start with the local rule label and be followed immediately by a colon and a single space. The label shall be in boldface. The colon shall not be boldface.

[example]
====
The following examples illustrate the layout and format of formal propositions:

[%unnumbered]
----
WR1: The value of x shall be positive.
UR1: The name shall be unique.
----
====

* The ISO required verbal forms "shall" (see <<isodir2, clause "7">>) shall be used.
* Any additional explanation or examples shall be provided as notes (see <<isodir2, clause "24">>) or examples (see <<isodir2, clause "25">>).
* The order of the formal propositions shall be the same as the order of the constraint specifications in the EXPRESS declarations.
* There shall be a one-to-one correspondence between the local rules stated in the EXPRESS declaration (`WHERE`, `INVERSE`, and `UNIQUE` constraints) and the elements in the list of formal propositions.
* If a local rule uses a call to an EXPRESS function, the effect of the tests within that function as they are applied to this type or entity data type shall be briefly described. A statement that the function shall return the value `TRUE` is not adequate. A local rule is satisfied if the evaluated result of the rule expression is `TRUE` or `UNKNOWN`; a function used within a local rule may never return `UNKNOWN`.

[[scls_6-7-7]]
==== Documentation of informal propositions

Informal propositions are un-computable constraints that cannot, or cannot reasonably, be written in EXPRESS, although each informal proposition still represents a requirement. If an EXPRESS declaration exists or EXPRESS-like pseudo-code has been written, it may be included in an informative annex as a technical discussion. Each informal proposition shall be presented as follows.

* The informal propositions shall be preceded by the underlined title "Informal propositions:".
* Each informal proposition shall be given a label, corresponding to the local rule labels that appear in formal propositions. By convention, informal propositions in ISO 10303 parts are labelled IP1, IP2, and so on.

NOTE: Several legacy resources use a short English word for a label. That usage is acceptable only for those existing labels.

* The ISO required verbal forms "shall" (see <<isodir2, clause "7">>) shall be used.
* Any additional explanation or examples shall be provided as notes (see <<isodir2, clause "24">>) or examples (see <<isodir2, clause "25">>).

The explanation for each information proposition shall state the conditions and requirements that shall be met by instances of the type or the entity data type.

[[scls_6-7-8]]
==== Type documentation requirements

The following rules apply to the documentation of types.

* Document each type in the "<schema name> type definitions" subclause in a separate subclause. The title of the subclause shall be the name of the type exactly as it appears in the EXPRESS declaration (lower case with underscores).
* The title shall be followed by a textual definition of the type and any supporting material necessary to define the intent of the type. In particular, this text should demonstrate how this type is different from any other similar type.
* The EXPRESS declaration shall be given next using the format described in <<scls_6-2-9>>, separated from the text by comment markers as described in <<scls_6-2-4>>. The title "EXPRESS specification:" shall be placed immediately before the close-comment marker.
* If the type is an enumeration of items, the items may be defined following the EXPRESS declaration. Definitions of enumerated items shall be given for clarity, unless the item corresponds exactly to a term defined in the terms and definitions clause (see <<isodir2, clause "16">>) of the standard. If the enumeration item corresponds to a defined term, a reference to the definition of the term shall be included as a note. The title "Enumerated item definitions:" shall precede the definitions of the enumeration items. Each enumerated item definition shall consist of the identifier of the item in boldface, a colon, one space, and the definition of the item.
* If the type is an extensible select, the definition shall begin with a required wording, followed by any necessary explanation of the domain concepts. An example is given below (see <<scls_5-3>> for implementing the required text).

[%unnumbered]
----
[ISO_10303:10303_express_schema-select]

The <name of extensible select> type is an extension of the <name of select> type. It adds the data types <list of data types> to the list of alternate data types.

NOTE The list of entity data types may be extended in application modules that use the constructs of this module.

[end_ISO_10303]
----

* If the type is an extensible enumeration, the definition shall begin with the following wording, followed by any necessary explanation of the domain concepts.

The <name of extensible select> type is an extension of the <name of select> type. It adds the enumeration items <list of enumeration items > to the list of alternate enumeration items.

NOTE The list of enumerations may be extended in application modules that use the constructs of this module.

[end_ISO_10303]
----

* Formal propositions (see <<scls_6-7-6>>) follow the EXPRESS declaration or the definition of enumeration items.
* Informal propositions (see <<scls_6-7-7>>) follow the formal propositions

[[scls_6-7-9]]
==== Entity data type documentation

[[scls_6-7-9-1]]
===== General requirements

The entity data types declared in a schema shall be documented in a subclause titled ""<schema name> entity data type definitions" or "<schema name> entity definitions". Entity data types may be collected into logical groups in order to enhance the readability and understandability of the schema. If such groups are used (there shall be at least two such groups), the following structure should be used for the entity definition subclause.

[%unnumbered]
----
  x.y.1 <schemaname>entitydatatypedefinitions:<logicalgroupname1>
  x.y.2 <schemaname>entitydatatypedefinitions:<logicalgroupname2>
  x.y.3 <schemaname>entitydatatypedefinitions:<logicalgroupname3>
  ...
  x.y.n <schemaname>entitydatatypedefinitions:<logicalgroupnamen>
----

All EXPRESS entity data types shall be at the same subclause level within each group.

All EXPRESS entity data types within a given functional grouping should be presented in an order that will aid understanding. An obvious and common ordering will present the EXPRESS entity data types according to the subtype/supertype hierarchy relationships among the entity data types.

If there is no other reasonable order, the entities shall appear in alphabetical order.

[[scls_6-7-9-2]]
===== Documenting a single entity data type

NOTE: See <<scls_6-9-2>> for an example of the documentation of an entity data type.

The following rules apply to documenting an entity data type.

* Each entity data type definition shall be a new subclause. The title of the subclause shall be the name of the entity data type exactly as it appears in the EXPRESS declaration (lower case with underscores). See <<scls_6-5-2-2>> for the requirements that apply to naming of entity data types.
* The definition of an entity data type shall state clearly the following:
+
--
** the concept that the entity data type represents;
** the information about the concept that is represented in the data structure and constraints defined by the entity data type.

The name of the entity data type without underscore and in normal text (not boldface) may be used to stand for the concept that the entity data type represents.
--
* The follow convention may be used to simplify entity data type definitions. The phrase "an *<entity_data_type_name>* is/represents ..." may be used as a short hand for "An instance of the *<entity_data_type_name>* entity data type is/represents ...".
+
--
If this convention is used, it shall be used consistently for all entity data type definitions in the standard; the convention itself shall be described in the introduction of the standard.
--
* Examples may be provided to clarify the concept that is represented by the entity data type or to illustrate the population of the entity data type and its attributes. It shall be clear whether each example refers to the concept represented by the entity data type or the data that is governed by the entity data type. Examples follow the prose definition.
* Extra explanations and references to other sources for explanations should be given as one or more notes.
** Tables or figures may be included in the definition of an entity data type. If the information conveyed in the table or figure is essential to understanding of the entity data type, the table or figure shall be referenced from the normative text of the definition so that it is itself normative. If the information conveyed in the table or figure enhances but is not essential to understanding the entity data type, the table or figure shall be referenced from a suitable note or example so that it is itself informative.

The EXPRESS declaration for the entity data type follows the definition. The declaration shall be introduced by the underlined title "EXPRESS specification:" and delimited by comment markers as specified in <<scls_6-2-4>>.

Following the EXPRESS declaration, all attributes (both explicit and derived) shall be documented. The attribute definitions shall be introduced by the underlined title "Attribute definitions:". The following rules apply to the documentation of attribute definitions:

* The attributes shall be documented in the same order as they appear in the EXPRESS declaration.
* The attribute definitions shall be presented as follows.
+
--
** Each attribute definition shall start with the attribute name exactly as given in the EXPRESS declaration (complete with underscores), in boldface, and followed by a colon.
** The definition of the attribute shall follow the name of the attribute, starting on the same line.
** The definition of the attribute shall describe the role of that attribute in the entity data type. If the attribute uses another entity data type or type, there is no need to give a definition for the referenced item.

NOTE: If it appears necessary to redefine the referenced item, indicating that meaning of the referenced type varies according to its use, consider defining a new intersection entity data type.
--
* Additional explanation may be given as notes.
* Examples that illustrate the population or usage of the attribute may also be given.

Formal propositions (see <<scls_6-7-6>>) follow the attribute definitions. Formal propositions shall only be included where the result of the evaluation depends on the values of the attributes, the complex type of instances, or both. If the formal proposition always returns true, it shall not be included as a formal proposition but rather should be included as part of the definition of the entity data type.

Informal propositions (see <<scls_6-7-7>>) follow the formal propositions.

[[scls_6-7-9-3]]
===== References to attributes declared in supertypes

A reference to an attribute declared in a supertype may be explained with a note following the first use of the attribute name.

[example]
====
The following example illustrates the wording of such a note:

[%unnumbered]
----
NOTE The attribute <a_name> is declared in the <e_name> entity data type of which this entity data type is a subtype.
----
====

[[scls_6-7-9-4]]
===== Plurals of

Avoid using plurals of EXPRESS object names by an alternate usage, such as "several instances of the *vertex* entity data type." If necessary, plurals of EXPRESS object names may be made by adding an "s" (not in boldface) to the end of the name. This includes names for which the plural in English changes the spelling of the word.

[example]
The following example illustrates the addition of an "s" to refer to multiple instances of the vertex entity data type: "An *open_path*) visits its **vertex**s exactly once.".

NOTE: The wording specified in the example above is much clearer if changed to: "Each instance of open_path visits each of its instances of *vertex* exactly once.".

[[scls_6-7-10]]
==== Rule documentation requirements

The following requirements apply to documenting rules.

* All rules shall be declared/defined in the "<schema name> rule definitions" subclause.
* Each rule shall constitute a new subclause. The title shall be the name of the rule exactly as it appears in the EXPRESS declaration (lower case with underscores). This name should not be abbreviated and should comprise, where possible, proper English words (see <<scls_6-5-2-6>> for constraints on the maximum length of EXPRESS identifiers).
* If there is only one rule declaration in a schema, the rule declaration shall appear in a single subclause titled "<schema name> rule definition: <rule name>".
* The title shall be followed by a prose definition and any supporting text necessary to state the intent of the rule.
* The EXPRESS declaration shall follow the definition, preceded by the underlined title "EXPRESS specification:".
* The arguments of the rule shall be defined following the EXPRESS declaration, preceded by the underlined title "Argument definitions:".
* The argument definitions shall be presented as follows.
** Each argument definition shall start with the argument name exactly as given in the EXPRESS declaration (complete with underscores), in boldface, followed by a colon.
** The definition of the argument shall follow the name of the argument, starting on the same line.

* Each constraint within the WHERE clause of the rule shall have a unique label. Unless an appropriate short English word can be used, the form of the label shall be WRn where n is an integer giving the position of the rule in the list.

NOTE: By convention, schemas defined in parts of ISO 10303 use the WRn form only.

* Each constraint within the WHERE clause of the rule shall be documented as a formal proposition (see <<scls_6-7-6>>). The formal propositions follow the argument definitions.
* If a constraint is dependent on an unelaborated function or procedure (see <<scls_6-7-12>>), this should be stated in a note.

[example]
The following example illustrates the wording of such a note.

NOTE: This rule is based on an unelaborated EXPRESS function.

[[scls_6-7-11]]
==== Subtype constraint documentation requirements

The following requirements apply to documenting subtype constraints.

* All subtype constraints shall be declared/defined in the "<schema name> subtype constraint definitions" subclause.
* Each subtype constraint shall constitute a new subclause. The title shall be the name of the subtype constraint exactly as it appears in the EXPRESS declaration (lower case with underscores). This name should not be abbreviated (see <<scls_6-5-2-6>> for constraints on the maximum length of EXPRESS identifiers).
* If there is only one subtype constraint declaration in a schema, the declaration shall appear in a single subclause titled "<schema name> subtype constraint definition: < subtype constraint name>".
* The title shall be followed by a prose definition and any supporting text necessary to state the intent of the subtype constraint.
* The EXPRESS declaration shall follow the definition, preceded by the underlined title "EXPRESS specification:".

[[scls_6-7-12]]
==== Function (procedure) documentation requirements

[[scls_6-7-12-1]]
===== General requirements

The following rules apply to documenting function (or procedure) definitions:

* All functions shall be declared/defined in the "<schema name> function definitions" subclause.
* Each function shall constitute a new subclause. The title shall be the name of the function exactly as it appears in the EXPRESS declaration (lower case with underscores). The name should not be abbreviated (see <<scls_6-5-2-6>> for constraints on the maximum length of EXPRESS identifiers).
* If there is only one function declaration in a schema, it should appear in a single subclause titled <schema name> function definition: "<function name>".
* The title shall be followed by a definition and any supporting text necessary to define the intent of the function.
* The EXPRESS declaration shall follow the definition, preceded by the underlined title "EXPRESS specification:".
* The arguments of the function shall be defined following the EXPRESS declaration, preceded by the underlined title "Argument definitions:".
* The argument definitions shall be presented as follows.
** Each argument definition shall start with the argument name exactly as given in the EXPRESS declaration (complete with underscores), in boldface, followed by a colon.
** The definition of the argument shall follow the name of the argument, starting on the same line. Each definition shall include whether the argument is an input, output, or both, and enumerate and define any error conditions that may result from the function.

EXPRESS functions and procedures and their application to entities may be documented by three different methods according to the completeness of the specification included in the standard. These methods are as follows:

* functions and procedures that are fully specified in EXPRESS (see <<scls_6-7-12-2>>);
* functions and procedures that cannot, or cannot easily, be specified in EXPRESS but can be implemented within a specific application system (see <<scls_6-7-12-3>>);
* functions or procedures that cannot be implemented at all, either within EXPRESS or within an application system (see <<scls_6-7-12-4>>).

When the EXPRESS declaration of a function is not or cannot be explicitly specified, an EXPRESS comment should replace the body of the function stating the following:

* why the appropriate EXPRESS language statements are missing;
* what the function is intended to do.

[[scls_6-7-12-2]]
===== Functions and procedures fully specified in EXPRESS

Functions and procedures fully specified in EXPRESS shall be documented as follows.

* The full EXPRESS specification of the function or procedure shall be documented in an appropriate subclause.
* The function or procedure shall be used as part of the definition of a constraint in one or more types or entity data types.

[example]
====
The following example illustrates a fragment of the EXPRESS declaration for a fully specified function:

[%unnumbered]
----
*)
FUNCTION function_name (x:INTEGER): LOGICAL;

<function body in EXPRESS>

END_FUNCTION;
(*
----
====

[example]
====
The following example illustrates a fragment of the EXPRESS declaration of an entity data type that uses the function illustrated above to define a constraint:

[%unnumbered]
----
*)
ENTITY foo;
...
WHERE
  WR1: function_name(...); END_ENTITY;
(*
...

Formal propositions:

WR1: xxx;
----
====

[[scls_6-7-12-3]]
===== Functions and procedures that can be implemented within a specific application system

Functions and procedures that cannot, or cannot easily, be implemented in EXPRESS but can be implemented within a specific application system, shall be documented as follows.

* The EXPRESS specification of the function or procedure shall include the phrase "unelaborated function/procedure" as a tail remark together with text describing the intent of the function.
* The function or procedure shall be used as part of the definition of a constraint in one or more types or entity data types.

[example]
====
The following example illustrates a fragment of the EXPRESS declaration for an unelaborated function:

[%unnumbered]
----
*)
FUNCTION function_name (x:INTEGER): LOGICAL;

-- unelaborated function

(* <text that explains the intent of the function. Note that the
text is commented out between the function head and tail.> *)

END_FUNCTION;
(*
----
====

The tail comment shall be inserted as shown so that it will occur in the EXPRESS listing of the schema.

An explanation of why the function is not elaborated may be placed in a note following the textual description of the function.

[example]
====
The following example illustrates a fragment of the EXPRESS declaration of an entity data type that uses the function illustrated above to define a constraint:

[%unnumbered]
----
*)
ENTITY foo;
...
WHERE
  WR1: function_name(...); END_ENTITY;
(*

...

Formal propositions:

WR1: xxx;

NOTE This proposition is based upon an unelaborated EXPRESS function or procedure.
----
====

The note following the formal proposition shall be included to indicate that an EXPRESS declaration for the function exists, but that it has not been elaborated.

[[scls_6-7-12-4]]
===== Constraints that cannot be implemented

Not all constraints can be implemented in a uniform manner, either within EXPRESS or within an application system.

Such constraints shall be documented as follows:

* If the constraint applies to a single entity data type, it shall be defined in an informal proposition (see <<scls_6-7-7>>) within the documentation of that entity data type.
* If the constraint applies to two or more entity data types, it shall be defined as a pseudo-function, in a separate subclause. However, no EXPRESS declaration shall be given.

[[scls_6-7-13]]
==== End of schema declaration

The EXPRESS declaration shall be the last item of the last subclause within each schema clause. The text below is shown as example (see <<scls_5-3>> for implementing the required text).

[%unnumbered]
----
[General:SC4_express_schema-end]

*)
END_SCHEMA; -- <schema name>

[end _General]
----

[[scls_6-8]]
=== EXPRESS-G diagram style

Each EXPRESS-G diagram shall follow the format in Annex D of ISO 10303-11 with additional rules listed below.

* For the entity data type names in EXPRESS-G diagrams, the recommended font is Times New Roman, 10pt.
* For the attribute names and labels in EXPRESS-G diagrams, the recommended font is Times New Roman, 9pt.
* If possible, each schema shall occupy one page. A schema may occupy more than one page, if necessary, and two schemas may occupy a single page if each fits onto one-half page.
* There shall be no boxes around EXPRESS-G diagrams.
* All entity data types declared in the schema shall be included.
* All select, enumeration, and defined types shall be included.
* All subtype constraints need to be included.
* Inter-schema references shall be included for all interfaced constructs.
* The abbreviations L, S, B, and A shall be used for aggregate types of attributes and types to indicate list, set, bag, and array respectively.
* Cardinality of attributes and types shall be indicated when appropriate by appending the bound specification to the aggregate abbreviation.
* Inverse and derived attributes shall be included in the EXPRESS-G diagrams and indicated by "(INV)" and "(DER)" respectively.
* The "to" end of an emphasized direction of a relationship shall be indicated by an open circle. The relationship line shall not enter the circle.
* Each attribute whose domain is a simple data type (`BINARY`, `BOOLEAN`, `LOGICAL`, `STRING`, `NUMBER`, `INTEGER`, or `REAL`) may omit the simple data type and terminate with the same open circle as used for emphasized direction.
* In ISO 10303, each attribute whose domain is one of the defined types *identifier*, *label*, or *text* may omit the defined type and terminate with the same open circle as used for emphasized direction.
+
NOTE: The types *identifier*, *label*, and *text* are defined in the support_resources_schema in ISO 10303-41.
* The weight (thickness or width) of lines forming the symbols used for entity data types, select types, defined types, enumeration types, base types, subtype constraints, schema references, and off-page connectors shall be approximately 1mm.
* The thickness of a SUPERTYPE relationship line, select type and enumeration type BASED_ON lines shall be at least twice that of the attribute relationship lines.
* All dashed lines shall be comprised of lines and gaps with a "unit" length between 2mm and 4 mm.
* All relationship lines shall be oriented either vertically or horizontally (no diagonal lines or curves).

== ISO 8000 series: additional requirements for structure and content of parts

[[scls_7-1]]
=== General

For all parts in the ISO 8000 series, the following documents provide applicable requirements:

* the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018, _Principles and rules for the structure and drafting of ISO and IEC documents_;
* The ISO Simple template.

In addition, <<cls_5>> of this document (Requirements for the structure and content of parts of SC4 standards) applies.

[[scls_7-2]]
=== Specific requirements

Each part of ISO 8000 should:

* include notes and examples to clarify the understanding of all key concepts in the document, typically at the point in the document when the concept first appears;

NOTE: Appropriate normative content for standards consists of precise, technical statements, which are not necessarily immediately clear to the uninitiated reader. A note or example provides a less abstract view of the topic to illustrate the correct interpretation of normative text. Such notes and examples are not, however, normative, so the document is usable without them.

* describe the scope of activities to which the document applies by including an IDEF0 model;

NOTE: ISO/IEC/IEEE 31320-1 <<iso31320>> specifies the syntax and semantics of IDEF0 models.

* consist of text that follows appropriate style of language to assist in the consistent and easy interpretation of meaning;

[example]
Ensuring that each new sentence within a paragraph begins with a concept that has already appeared in that paragraph. This approach is shown by the underlined words in the following: "The content of ISO 9000 explains that *quality* is not an abstract concept of absolute perfection. *Quality* is actually the conformance …".

* make use of terms in a way that is consistent with the corresponding definitions in ISO 8000-2 <<iso8000>>;

NOTE: ISO 8000-2 exists to harmonize all terms and definitions across all parts of the ISO 8000 series. Project teams add new entries and propose changes as necessary to incorporate each part into this harmonized view of the vocabulary for ISO 8000.

* prior to publication include entries for relevant terms in <<cls_3>> and a note "Prior to publication of this document as an International Standard, the following terms and definitions will be published in ISO 8000 2 and removed from this document";
* include appropriate cross-references to other parts of the ISO 8000 series to support and promote the aggregated capability of the whole series;
* include references to appropriate entries in the Bibliography, where such entries provide additional information on the implementation and associated benefits of the document.

The published parts of ISO 8000 shall not include any terms in <<cls_3>>.

NOTE: ISO 8000-2 includes all terms for all parts of ISO 8000.

[[scls_7-3]]
=== ISO 8000 series required text

All parts of the ISO 8000 series shall include identified required text.

This required text is defined and managed by the working group responsible for the series and is available in a shared repository.

The repository is located under [GIT ISO URL]/projects/ISOTC184SC4/repos/boilerplate.

Each writer shall ensure that the boilerplate text in an SC 4 standard conforms to the boilerplate text released in the repository.

A guide "How to use the required text" is at <<annexC>> of this document.

[[cls_8]]
== ISO 10303 series: additional requirements for structure and content of parts

[[scls_8-1]]
=== General

For all parts in the ISO 10303 series, the following documents provide applicable requirements:

* ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018, _Principles and rules for the structure and drafting of ISO and IEC documents;_
* the ISO Simple template;
* ISO 10303-1, _Industrial automation systems and integration — Product data representation and exchange — Part 1: Overview and fundamental principles_.

In addition, <<cls_5>> of this document (Requirements for the structure and content of SC4 standards) applies.

* the following individual groups of parts within the ISO 10303 series have specific documentation requirements:

** the integrated resources series (see <<scls_8-2>>);
** the application protocol series (see <<scls_8-3>>);
** the application module series (see <<scls_8-4>>);
** the domain model series (see <<scls_8-5>>).

Single quotation marks are used to denote literal text string values. Double quotation marks follow standard British usage, for direct quoted material presented within other material, and titles of works following a specific bibliographic format. While quotation marks may be used to identify words being discussed as words, this usage is unlikely within the context of ISO 10303.

[[scls_8-1-1]]
==== ISO 10303 series required text

For all the documents of the ISO 10303 series a specific wording is required.

This specific wording is defined and managed by the working group responsible for the series and is available in a shared repository.

The repository is located under [GIT ISO URL]/projects/ISOTC184SC4/repos/boilerplate.

Each writer shall ensure that the boilerplate text in an SC 4 standard conforms to the boilerplate text released in the repository.

A guide "How to use the required text" is at Annex C of this document.

[[scls_8-1-2]]
==== Documentation of Introduction

The start of the introduction of each part of ISO 10303 is a required text (see <<scls_5-3>> for implementing the required text).

An example reads as follows:

=== Documentation of Integrated resources series (IR)

[[scls_8-2-1]]
==== General

For the documentation of the integrated resources series of parts for ISO 10303 the following documents apply:

* Documents listed in <<scls_8-1>>;
* ISO/TC 184/SC 4 N1548 — Guidelines for the format and layout of SC4 standards using HTML.
* ISO 10303 IR standard developers may use the STEPmod documentation environments depending on the scope of their standard. Guidelines for these are available here: STEPmod Tutorial <<eurostep>>.

A set of IRs (see <<integrated_resource>>) shall provide the specification of a representation of product information. Each IR comprises a set of descriptions, written in a formal data specification language, applicable to product data known as resource constructs. One set may be dependent on other sets for its definition. A single resource construct (See <<resource_construct>>) may represent similar information for different applications.

The IRs in ISO 10303 are divided into two groups: generic resources (See <<generic_resource>>) and application resources (See <<application_resource>>). The generic resources are independent of applications and may reference other resources. The application resources may reference other resources and may add other resource constructs for use by a group of similar applications. The IRs may reference product data descriptions written using EXPRESS from other International Standards.

Each part of ISO 10303 in the integrated resources series includes a clause for each schema that is documented in the part. See <<cls_6>> for requirements that apply to documenting EXPRESS schemas.

[example]
====
The clauses 4 to 7 of the ISO 10303-42 are the following:

[align=left]
4 Geometry, which is the Geometry schema +
5 Topology, which is the Topology schema +
6 Geometric model, which is the Geometric model schema +
7 Scan data 3d shape model, which is the Scan data 3d shape model schema

[[scls_8-2-3]]
==== Documentation of Introduction

The start of the introduction of each part of ISO 10303 that is a member of the integrated resources series is an ISO 10303 required text (see <<scls_5-3>> for implementing the required text).

An example reads as follows:

[%unnumbered]
----
[ISO_10303:10303_introduction]

ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable representation of product information and for the exchange of product data. The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing products throughout their life cycle. This mechanism is suitable not only for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases, and as a basis for retention and archiving.

[end_ISO_10303]
----

For the parts with more than one schema, use the following:

[%unnumbered]
----
[ISO_10303_IR:10303_IR_introduction-1]

Major subdivisions of this document are: <use list format to list the names of the schemas, or descriptions of groups of schemas>.

[end_ISO_10303_IR]
----

This wording may be followed by one or more paragraphs that provide an overview of the schema or schemas, without stating requirements. If information from the scope clause is repeated, use the same wording as in the scope.

In an integrated resources part, include a schema level model that illustrates the schema(s) specified in the context of the integrated resources as a whole, introduced by the following wording:

[%unnumbered]
----
[ISO_10303_IR:10303_IR_introduction-2]

The relationships of the schemas in this document to other schemas that define the integrated resources of ISO 10303 are illustrated in Figure <figure number> using the EXPRESS-G notation. EXPRESS-G is defined in Annex D of ISO 10303-11.

The <list schemas from other parts depicted in the diagram> are specified in <list the parts>. The schemas illustrated in Figure <figure number> are components of the integrated resources.

[end_ISO_10303_IR]
----

[[scls_8-2-4]]
==== Documentation of scope

The scope clause of a part of ISO 10303 in the integrated resources series provides a clear explanation of the technical boundaries addressed by the schemas specified in the part. For an integrated generic resource part, the scope describes the domain of applicability. For an integrated application resource part, the scope describes the application area.

An example of the wording to introduce the scope clause of a part of ISO 10303 that is a member of the integrated resources series is given below, followed by the SC 4 wording (See <<scls_5-5-4>> for general SC 4 requirements for the wording of the scope clause and see <<scls_5-3>> for implementing the required text).

[%unnumbered]
----
[ISO_10303_IR:10303_IR_scope-1]

This document specifies the integrated generic resource constructs for

[end_ISO_10303_IR]
----

This is followed by more detailed information in the form of a list as to what is within the scope of the document:

[%unnumbered]
----
[General:SC4_Scope_scope-2]

The following is (are) within the scope of this document: <list of in-scope elements>

[end_General]
----

After this, the following optional text introduces information that is outside the scope of the document:

[%unnumbered]
----
[General:SC4_Scope_scope-3]

The following is (are) outside the scope of this document: <list of out-scope elements>

[end _General]
----

The primary mechanism for defining the scope of each part in the integrated resources series is a simple text explanation of the information content of the part. At the minimum, an integrated resource part shall contain a narrative description of the scope of the information represented by the schema. It should describe the application area being addressed and any boundaries, limits, or rules used to determine whether something is in scope.

[[scls_8-2-5]]
==== Documentation of normative references

Each part of ISO 10303 that is related to the integrated resource constructs being documented shall be identified as a normative reference. A part of ISO 10303 containing a schema that is identified by a *REFERENCE FROM* EXPRESS statement in the integrated resource being documented is related and shall be listed as a normative reference.

[[scls_8-2-6]]
==== Documentation of the index

The index shall contain references to the declaration of each type, entity data type, function, and rule in the standard. The index shall reference the page on which the EXPRESS language statements of the declaration begin, rather than the page on which the clause or subclause containing the declarations begin.

NOTE: Because the underlined heading "EXPRESS specification" immediately precedes the EXPRESS declaration and always appears on the same page, this heading can be used as the target for the index entry.

The index shall contain only a single index entry for each EXPRESS element. Each index item shall contain only a single page number for each EXPRESS element.

The index may contain additional reference information; however, it shall not include the references from other EXPRESS declarations for an EXPRESS element index entry.

== ISO 15926 series: additional requirements for structure and content of parts

[[scls_9-1]]
=== General

For all parts in the ISO 15926 series, the following documents provide applicable requirements:

* the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018, Principles and rules for the structure and drafting of ISO and IEC documents;
* the ISO Simple template.

In addition, <<cls_5>> of this document (Requirements for the structure and content of SC4 standards) applies.

[[scls_9-2]]
=== Documentation of the introduction

The introduction of each part of ISO 15926 shall start with a required wording (see <<scls_5-3>> for implementing the required text). An example is shown as follows:

[%unnumbered]
----
[ISO_15926:15926-introduction]

ISO 15926 is an International Standard for the representation of process plant lifecycle information. This representation is specified by a generic, conceptual data model that is suitable as the basis for implementation in a shared database or data warehouse.

The data model is designed to be used in conjunction with reference data: standard instances that represent data common to a substantial number of experts from the process plant engineering supply chain.

The support for a specific life-cycle activity depends on the use of an appropriate selection of reference data in conjunction with an appropriate data model derived from the ISO 15926 data model ontology.

ISO 15926 is organized as a number of parts, each published separately. This document specifies:;

* ISO 15926 – 1: Overview and fundamental principles, published in 2004
* ISO 15926 – 2: Data model, published in 2003
* ISO/TS 15926 – 3: Reference data for geometry and topology, published in 2009
* ISO/TS 15926 – 4: Initial reference data, published in 2007
* ISO/TS 15926 – 6: Methodology for the development and validation of reference data, published in 2013
* ISO/TS 15926 – 7: Implementation methods for the integration of distributed systems: Template methodology, published in 2013
* ISO/TS 15926 – 8: Implementation methods for the integration of distributed systems: Web Ontology Language (OWL) implementation, published in 2013
* ISO/TS 15926 – 9: Implementation methods for the integration of distributed systems – Façade implementation, not yet in ballot
* ISO/TS 15926 – 10: Conformance testing, planned published in 2018
* ISO/TS 15926 – 11: Methodology for simplified industrial usage of reference data, published in 2015
* ISO/TS 15926 – 12: Life cycle integration ontology represented in OWL, planned published in 2018

[appendix,obligation=informative]
== Tutorial on ASN.1 identifiers

=== Introduction

SC 4 uses three separate terms to manage the various components of its standards. These terms are as follows:

* edition;
* version;
* release.

The term "edition" identifies a published document. The method of identifying the edition is by the year of publication. Thus, we refer to Part 21 as ISO 10303-21:1994. When a second edition of Part 21 is published, its identifier will differ by the year of its publication.

The term "version" identifies the normative content of a standard. For the initial edition of each SC 4 standard, there is a one to one correspondence between the edition and the version. However, if technical corrigenda or amendments to the standard are published, the version of the technical content changes. In general, there is not a simple relationship between edition and version. The version is meant to identify the technical content to which conformance may be claimed.

For example, because the published version of Part 21 contained technical errors, it was necessary to issue a technical corrigendum to this part. The version of the original publication is 1; the version of effective standard, after applying the technical corrigendum is 2. Note that version 2 of Part 21 is documented in the two publications, the IS of Part 21, and the TC to Part 21, and not just a single document. Similarly, if an amendment to Part 21 is adopted, the version of the effective standard will be 3, and will be documented in the three publications taken together.

The version is defined as part of the object identifier defined in an annex of each SC 4 standard. The value of that object identifier is described below.

The term "release" is used by SC 4 to manage the publications of groups of parts; historically, this term has been primarily applied to ISO 10303, although future planning for SC 4 standards includes releases that comprise parts of several standards. The release is not explicitly defined within any part of a standard. It is used solely for managing the development of STEP.

=== Object identifiers

An object identifier is a primitive data type defined in ASN.1, ISO/IEC 8824-1. The value identifies a node in a tree structure by providing a sequence of (positive) integers, each of which identifies a link in the tree. The notation used in SC 4 is the value notation defined in ISO/IEC 8824.

The syntax of this value notation is a sequence of node specifiers enclosed in braces (curly brackets) and separated by spaces. The syntax of each node specifier is one of the following:

* a number;
* a symbol;
* a symbol followed by a number in parentheses.

Whichever syntax is chosen, the resulting value must reduce to a sequence of integers. These choices are described below.

* A number. This syntax is self-identifying; the value of the node identifier is the value of the number. Any object identifier can optionally be written as a series of numbers. See the example below.
* A symbol. This syntax can be used only for the first or second node, and the only symbols that may be used are those defined in the annexes of ISO/IEC 8824-1. For our purposes, this restriction means that the first part of all object identifiers must be
+
--
[%unnumbered]
----
{ iso standard }
----

which is equivalent to the object identifier

[%unnumbered]
----
{ 1 0 }
----
--
* A symbol followed by a number in parenthesis. If this form is used, the value of the node is the value of the number. The symbol is a local variable that is automatically assigned the value of the number. Because there are no other uses for this symbol in the syntax, the only utility of this form is to give a human readable idea of the meaning of the node. Thus, we will use "version(1)" to indicate that we are dealing with the first version of something. We can equally refer to this node as "1". Both forms evaluate to 1; the first form associates the semantics of "version" with this value.

The lexical syntax of terms in the object identifier is similar to that of EXPRESS, except that occurrences of underscore (_) shall be replaced by hyphen(-).

In the annexes, ISO/IEC 8824-1 defines the four topmost levels of all object identifiers. In particular, it defines the form

[%unnumbered]
----
{ 1 0 n nn }
----

to be an object identifier that identifies an ISO standard number "n", part "nn". It then provides for the committee or subcommittee that wrote the standard to assign other nodes beneath this for identifying information objects related to this standard. Note that this identifier can also be written

[%unnumbered]
----
{ iso standard n part(nn) }
----

which is closer to the form we normally use. In this notation, the defined symbol "iso" has the value 1, and the defined symbol "standard" has the value 0.

To repeat, ISO (in ISO/IEC 8824-1) defines the interpretation of the nodes at the first four positions of these object identifiers. The subcommittee writing the standard (in this case, SC 4) controls the semantics of nodes at lower positions.

SC 4 has decided to associate the fifth node with the version of the information object being identified. This decision means that a standard form of the object identifier for the (part of the) standard considered as a whole is

[%unnumbered]
----
{ iso standard 10303 part(nn) version(v) }
----

SC 4 has adopted the convention that the sixth node identifies an object type, and the succeeding node or nodes identify a specific instance of that object type. The initial release defined only a single value for the object type; object(1) indicates that the object being identified is a schema. In the future, SC 4 may define other values for this node to cover other information objects such as entities, defined types, conformance classes, or parts libraries. Object values of 2 and greater are available for this purpose when the need arises. As of today, however, the only valid value of the sixth node is 1.

As corrigenda or amendments to the standards or new editions of the standards are published, the version number of the total content of the standard shall be increased by 1 to reflect the new content. It may be that in adopting a new edition of some standard, some information objects (schemas) within the standard will be unchanged from the previous versions. In this case the object identifier that identifies that information object (schema) should be the same as in the previous version of the standard, indicating that that particular item (schema) is unchanged.

== Criteria for lexical definitions

"Because the function of a lexical definition is to report the way a word is actually used in a language, lexical definitions are the ones we most frequently encounter and are what most people mean when they speak of the ‘definition’ of a word. Accordingly, it is appropriate that we have a set of rules that we may use in constructing lexical definitions of our own and in evaluating the lexical definitions of others."

*Rule l*: A lexical definition should conform to the standards of proper grammar.

*Rule 2*: A lexical definition should convey the essential meaning of the word being defined.

The aspects mentioned in the definition should be the important or necessary features of the thing defined, not trivial ones.

*Rule 3*: A lexical definition should be neither too broad nor too narrow.

A definition is too broad if the definition applies to things other than the things that are being defined.

[example]
====
For the term "data governance", the definition:

* "development and enforcement of policies related to the management of data" is correct;
* "development of policies related to the management of data" is too broad, because this incorrectly includes situations where an organization is not also performing enforcement;
* "development and enforcement of policies related to the management of digital data" is too narrow because organizations also have a responsibility to handle hard-copy documents appropriately.
====

*Rule 4*: A lexical definition must not be circular.

A circular definition uses the definiendum in some way in the definition and is thus not genuinely informative.

[example]
In the definitions of "data administrator" and "data technician" below the definition is circular because the two terms use each other in their definitions:

*_data administrator_*

person who controls and coordinates the work of *_data technicians_* by defining criteria needed to maintain data quality, designing data schema, and analysing the causes of errors to prevent their recurrence

NOTE: By providing supporting resources and guidelines to data technicians, the data administrator puts the data quality plan into practice.

*_data technician_*

person who creates, reads, modifies, and deletes data in accordance with the guidelines for data quality management set by the *_data administrator_*, and measures data quality and corrects data errors found as a result of data quality measurement

The definition of "data technician" has been modified to:

data technician

person who creates, reads, modifies, and deletes data in accordance with the guidelines for data quality management and measures data quality and corrects data errors found as a result of measuring data quality.

NOTE: The data administrator sets the guidelines for data quality management.

*Rule 5*: A lexical definition should not be negative when it can be affirmative.

*Rule 6*: A lexical definition should not be expressed in figurative, obscure, vague, or ambiguous language.
* A definition is figurative if it involves metaphors or tends to paint a picture instead of exposing the essential meaning of a term.

[example]
"Architecture means frozen music".

* A definition is obscure if its meaning is hidden. One source of obscurity is overly technical language.
* A definition is vague if its meaning is blurred.
* A definition is ambiguous if it lends itself to more than one distinct interpretation.

*Rule 7*: A lexical definition should avoid affective terminology.

Affective terminology is any kind of word usage that plays upon the emotions of the reader or listener.

*Rule 8*: A lexical definition should indicate the context to which the definition pertains.

This rule applies to any definition in which the context of the definition if important to the meaning of the definiendum. Whenever the definiendum is a word that means different things in different context is, a reference to the context is important.
